A university project designed to manage a fleet of simulated autonomous vehicles using Docker containers and deployed to a virtual machine on the Google Cloud Platform. The vehicles connect to the application through a Mosquitto broker and request routes to perform. The cloud services for this application use several containers to coordinate route generation and distribution, as well as keeping records on the state of the vehicles and plate assignment in a MariaDB database.
